    <p>

      I truly believe that there are endless possibilities when it comes to creating a website. <br>
      As an artist who wants to investigate website interactivity, <br>
      I want to create a website that incorporates interaction.<br>
      <br>
      In a previous project, I had designed a website with a similar function, <br>
      but encountered an issue where the images would stick together. <br>
      This time, I have successfully resolved that problem.<br>
      <br>
      Given the author's mention of a house, a cloud, and later, a rock, <br>
      my goal is to allow viewers to freely drag<br>
      around these elements and engage with them.
