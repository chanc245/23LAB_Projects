    <p>"In other words, a website creator becomes both author and architect simultaneously.
      There are endless possibilities as to what a website could be. What kind of room is a website?
      Or is a website more like a house? A boat? A cloud? A garden? A puddle?

      when you put energy into a website, in turn the website helps form your own identity."</p>

    <p>here are some rock, plant, cloud, and house you can drag around :)</p>
