Some ideas that I wanted to do but didn't do it because 
    1. Too much work or 
    2. I have no idea how to do it

IDEA ONE:
- Require user to "switch on" the website 
    -> start from a switch saying turn on 
    -> before switch on, it's all black
    -> after switch -> can be able to see eveyrthing 

IDEA TWO:
- Have links to different searching engine 
    -> but might bring people to different regin's engine (opens in seperate page)
        -> EX: click on Yahoo might bring you to Yahoo uk or Yahoo jp etc. 

- Quote: “Although there is only one internet, it is different in each country.” 

IDEA THREE:
- The user is being track 
    -> there's a place where the user will be able to see how they are being tracked 
    -> they can see how many times they have clicked on website 


IDEA FOUR:
- The user is able to see what quote of where I got my idea from (direct quote from the webpage)

IDEA FIVE:
- a button that can being the user to a randon website (or search engin)
    -> how is this possible? using API??
